Generating Sine Wave using Lookup Table
This project demonstrates how to generate a sine wave using a lookup table and output it through a Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) in an embedded system. The code is written in C and targets a microcontroller environment.
Secondly generates sine wave of frequency of 1000Hz,2000Hz and 3000Hz for 1 second each.
